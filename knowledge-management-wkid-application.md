ðŸ“š Application of the WKID Pyramid â€” Knowledge Management Exercise
1. Selection of a specific theme or problem:
Chosen theme:

Organizing an efficient study routine for my Artificial Intelligence education.

Justification:

As an AI undergraduate student, I deal with multiple sources of content (courses, articles, videos, books) and need to manage knowledge strategically to improve retention, productivity, and career readiness.

2. Definition of relevant raw data:
Collected raw data:

List of completed courses (Alura, university, and external platforms).

Study materials (PDFs, slides, scientific articles).

Lecture and seminar videos.

Performance statistics (daily study hours, task completion rates, quiz scores).

Class notes and previous reports.

3. Transformation of raw data into useful information:
Transformation process:

Organizing materials into categories (Machine Learning, Data Science, Python, etc.).

Analyzing performance results to identify strengths and weaknesses.

Identifying recurring topics in job listings and AI market demands.

Prioritizing content based on practical relevance and future applicability.

Result:

Creation of a personalized weekly study schedule, setting clear goals for each focus area based on skill demands.

4. Application of the acquired knowledge in practice:
Practical actions based on the acquired knowledge:

Developing a study plan focused on hands-on projects and exercise consolidation.

Using AI (ChatGPT) to generate automatic quizzes based on personal study summaries.

Applying knowledge management techniques: periodic review of summaries, creating mind maps for complex concepts.

Structuring a technical portfolio on GitHub, organizing projects by knowledge area (e.g., Machine Learning, Data Analysis).

5. Reflection on the contribution of the WKID Pyramid to the initiative's success:
Impact of the WKID Pyramid:

Using the WKID Pyramid was crucial for transforming a large volume of scattered data into a clear, structured action plan.

The raw data stage highlighted the variety and quantity of available resources.

The useful information transformation allowed me to filter and prioritize relevant content aligned with my goals.

The consolidated knowledge guided the creation of an efficient and practical study routine.

Finally, applying wisdom helped me understand the importance of continuously managing and adapting my learning processes to market demands.

This methodology can be applied in any academic, professional, or personal project to make decisions more informed and strategic.

ðŸš€ Conclusion
The practical application of the WKID Pyramid in managing my knowledge related to Artificial Intelligence provided greater clarity, productivity, and strategic alignment in my studies, helping to advance my career objectives effectively.
